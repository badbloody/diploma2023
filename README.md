All of the code in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that is used in my diploma thesis for neural style transfer, based on the paper [**Meta Networks for Neural Style Transfer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04111), Shen et al.

+ Get the style images [here](https://github.com/badbloody/diplomskiSlike)

* The original unchanged model can be found in [original_model.ipynb](https://github.com/badbloody/diploma2023/blob/main/original_model.ipynb) 
* My model can be found and trained with the notebook [my_method.ipynb](https://github.com/badbloody/diploma2023/blob/main/my_method.ipynb) 
* The content and style datasets are created in the notebook [creating_datasets.ipynb](https://github.com/badbloody/diploma2023/blob/main/creating_datasets.ipynb) 
* Loading 2 models and testing them on the same datasets - [comparing_models.ipynb](https://github.com/badbloody/diploma2023/blob/main/comparing_models.ipynb) 
* To calculate the FID (Frechet Inception Distance) score, use notebook [fid_score.ipynb](https://github.com/badbloody/diploma2023/blob/main/fid_score.ipynb)
